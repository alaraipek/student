## #5: The ticket prices at a movie theater are given below. <image of table>

A table is shown with 2 columns and 4 rows. The first row of the table contains the column headers, from left to right, Type of Ticket and Price in dollars. The table is as follows: Regular, 12 Child ages 12 and below, 9 Senior ages 60 and above, 9 Below the table is the text: Additional 5 dollar fee for 3 D movies

A programmer is creating an algorithm to set the value of One word, ticket Price based on the information in the table. The programmer uses the integer  variable age for the age of the moviegoer. The Boolean variable One word, is 3 D is true when the movie is 3-D and false otherwise.

Which of the following code segments correctly sets the value of One word, ticket Price ?

Correct Answer: D
Answer D:
ticket price <--12
if age<=12 or age>=60

# Question I Missed

Consider the following program.

count <- 1
sum <- 0
REPEAT 10 TIMES
    sum <- sum + count
    count <- count + 2
DISPLAY sum

Explanation: The value of count starts at 1 and increases by twos, so it counts odd integers. The loop iterates 10 times, adding each intermediate value of count each time. Therefore, the program displays the sum of the odd integers starting at 1 and ending at 19.
