# Program Function and Purpose
## Program With a List

# Importing necessary libraries (optional for this example)
import random

# Step 1: Create a list of numbers
numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]

# Step 2: Display the list
print("List of Numbers:", numbers)

# Step 3: Calculate the sum of the numbers
sum_of_numbers = sum(numbers)
print("Sum of Numbers:", sum_of_numbers)

# Step 4: Find the maximum and minimum numbers in the list
max_number = max(numbers)
min_number = min(numbers)
print("Maximum Number:", max_number)
print("Minimum Number:", min_number)

This example demonstrates the creation of a program with a list of random numbers and performs basic operations like displaying the list, calculating the sum, and finding the maximum and minimum numbers in the list.

# Program With Iteration
//loops

### Step 1: Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

### Step 2: Iterate through the list and perform an operation (e.g., square each number)
squared_numbers = []
for num in numbers:
    squared_numbers.append(num ** 2)

### Step 3: Display the squared numbers
print("Original Numbers:", numbers)
print("Squared Numbers:", squared_numbers)

# Step 4: Calculate the sum of squared numbers using iteration
sum_of_squared_numbers = 0
for num in squared_numbers:
    sum_of_squared_numbers += num

print("Sum of Squared Numbers:", sum_of_squared_numbers)

In this example, we create a program with iteration using a for loop. We iterate through a list of numbers, square each number, display the squared numbers, and then calculate the sum of squared numbers using iteration. For loops are very useful in JavaScript.
