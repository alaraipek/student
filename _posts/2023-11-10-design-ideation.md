## Binary Logic Ideation

- Compilation of various binary-related and sourced activites
  - Similar to CoolMathGames, but 3 games and solely binary-related
        - Puzzle
        - Converting (with binary)
        - Binary math

## Details

# Binary Puzzle Solver

- Users are presented with a grid of zeros and ones
  - Objective is to solve binary puzzles by applying logical operations to make rows and columns add up to specific binary values.
  - Binary operations
    - Utilize bitwise AND, OR, XOR operations for puzzle-solving logic
    - Incorporate left and right shifts for dynamic puzzle generation
  - UI design
    - Display a grid with interactive cells
    - Include buttons for shifting bits (left and right) and performing logical operations

## Binary Converter Challenge

- Users are given randomly generated decimal numbers (.000 to .999) to convert to binary and vice versa
  - Score based on correctness and speed of conversions
  - Binary operations
    - Use bitwise AND, OR, XOR for binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary conversions
    - Incorporate left and right shifts for dynamic gameplay
- UI design
  - Display decimal and binary numbers for conversion
  - Include buttons for shifting bits and converting numbers

## Binary Math Problems

- Users solve binary math problems to update a score
  - Correctness and speed of solving problems (inputting correct answers) determine success
  - Binary operations
    - Integrate bitwise AND, OR, XOR operations into math problems
    - Use left and right shifts: dynamics
  - UI design
    - Display math problems
    - Text box to input answers
      - Feedback printed below based on answer correctness

## Sign-In Feature

- Display login
- Create multiple accounts and set up with backend
- Create passwords
