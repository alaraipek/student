## My Review
- I believe that I deserve a 3.9/4 because I worked really hard on my code and did it from scratch without ChatGPT. Moreover, I not only followed all the directions, but I also went above and beyond by creating a theme of a groccery store that simulates the ralphs website and instacart.

## Abby's Review
- She gave me a 3.88 out of 4 because she liked the organization of my code and how it was color coded. She also liked how I added in a website link with the code. One thing that she suggested was to demonstrate the code on vscode and jupyter instead of just jupyter.
