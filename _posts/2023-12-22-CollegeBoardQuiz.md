# Question 4

In a certain computer program, two positive integers are added together, resulting in an overflow error. Which of the following best explains why the error occurs?


A - The program attempted to perform an operation that is considered an undecidable problem.

B - The precision of the result is limited due to the constraints of using a floating-point representation.

C - The program can only use a fixed number of bits to represent integers; the computed sum is greater than the maximum representable value.

D - The program cannot represent integers; the integers are converted into decimal approximations, leading to rounding errors.

### - Answer: D
### - Correct Answer: C
### - Explanation: The overflow error occurs in the program because it can only use a fixed number of bits to represent integers, and the computed sum exceeds the maximum representable value. This limitation leads to an overflow condition where the result cannot be accurately stored within the allocated bits.

### - Answer: D
### - Correct Answer: B
### - Explanation: The given code initializes the variable "cost" to 6, representing the base ticket price. Subsequently, it increments the cost by 2 for individuals older than 12. Additionally, irrespective of age, there is an additional increase of 2 in the cost for those participating in a guided tour.

### - Answer: D
### - Correct Answer: B
### - Explanation: The provided code snippet directs the robot to advance when facing an open square. Upon encountering an absence of an open square in front, the robot executes a right turn. This sequence guides the robot's movement: forward to the upper right corner, right turn, forward to the bottom right corner, right turn, forward to the bottom left corner, right turn, and finally advancing two squares to reach the gray square.
