## Alara Ipek's Webpage 
This is my first blog ever.

## About Me
My name is Alara Ipek and for most of my life I lived in different areas of New York. As a result of growing up around snow, I love skiing and snowboarding. My hobbies include reading, playing piano, and surfing. Finally, my favorite destination I'd love to travel to but have yet to visit is Italy.
