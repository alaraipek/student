## Alara Ipek's Webpage 
This is my first blog ever! I hope you enjoy.

## About Me
My name is Alara Ipek and for most of my life I lived in different areas of New York. As a result of growing up around snow, I love skiing and snowboarding. My hobbies include reading, playing piano, and surfing. Finally, my favorite destination I'd love to travel to but have yet to visit is Italy.

## How This Blog Was Made
Throughout the first week of installations, I learned how to set up and use the development environment, VS Code. Along the way, my partner and I faced many challenges, but consequently developed debugging and problem solving skills. Many times, the issues Alisha and I encountered were of our own error. For example, we often mistyped a line of code and would run into a bug. However, we were able to ask each other questions and debug our mistakes through communication and collaboration. 
##  Planning

Besides coding, we also were introduced to new organizational tools online such as Scrum Board. Through Scrum Boards, we created the timeline shown above and planned due dates for installations to keep us on track throughout the project.

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
